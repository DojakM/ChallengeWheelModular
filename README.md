# WheelSpinModular

This is the modular version of github.com/DojakM/ChallengeWheel <br>
Additionally by being a Maven project one might get a deployed version of the app

A javafx application to motivate and coordinate daily challenges in all fields of interest one might desire!
The file is a GUI which allows to edit, spin and record Challenge Wheels and even has statistical graphics for a better understanding of ypur progress.
As it is more of a tool for enjoyment purposes, there is no plan of increasing the scope of this project.

Enjoy!
